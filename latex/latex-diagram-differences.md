# Differences and Mismatches: LaTeX Text vs. Sequence Diagrams

This document highlights the key differences and inconsistencies found between the textual descriptions in the LaTeX document (`latex/chap_03.tex`) and the sequence diagrams (specifically the "Approuver rendez-vous" diagram) concerning the "Manage Appointments" feature, with a focus on status handling.

## Status Updates by Officers

- **LaTeX Textual Description:**

  - The text describes officer actions like "Valider rendez-vous" (Validate appointment) and "Rejeter rendez-vous" (Reject appointment).
  - It states that these actions directly change the _appointment's_ status.
  - The statuses mentioned as outcomes for appointments are "validated" (Scenario 7) and "rejected" (Scenario 8).

- **Sequence Diagram ("Approuver rendez-vous"):**
  - The diagram illustrates an action, `approuverDemandeCPF` (which corresponds to approving a CPF Request).
  - This action is shown to result in the _CPF Request's_ status changing to "approved" or "rejected".
  - While this action is related to the appointment scheduling process, the diagram's focus is on the status update of the _CPF Request_ entity.

**Mismatch:**

The primary mismatch is that the **LaTeX text describes officer actions as directly modifying the _appointment's_ status to "validated" or "rejected"**, whereas the **sequence diagram (and the current code implementation) depicts the officer action as primarily affecting the _CPF Request's_ status to "approved" or "rejected"**, with a secondary effect on the appointment status (setting it to "scheduled" or "cancelled" in the code).

This suggests a potential discrepancy in the documentation regarding which entity's status is the primary focus of the officer's validation/rejection action and the specific status values used for the appointment itself in this context.
